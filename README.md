In this project I am presenting a restaurant menu.

When customers visit a restaurant, they can scan a QR code on the table and download the hotel menu. And next time they are coming they can decide while still at home, we will close the day today at CJ's restaurant and this is what we will eat.

It is a mobile app developed for mobile devices running Android.

To use the app as a restaurant menu for your own restaurant, with your own custom menu items, you only have to change the content of a dummy data class in the source code that I have named SampleDataProvider found under a sub-package I have called sample. That is the class that is seeding the database. So erase the existing data there, populate the class with your own data, your own menu item names, category, description, prices, etc, and the application will reflect your restaurant the next time it installs.

The application is created with Android studio Giraffe 2022.3.1

Compile SDK: Android Version 14, API Level 34, Upside Down Cake

Minimum SDK: Android Version 7, API Level 24, Noughat
